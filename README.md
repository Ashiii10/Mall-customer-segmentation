Mall Customer Segmentation
Project Description:
Mall customer segmentation is an essential business strategy used to identify distinct groups within a customer base. By applying machine learning clustering techniques, this project segments mall customers based on their demographic and behavioral features. The ultimate goal is to help businesses understand their customers better, enabling personalized marketing and improving customer satisfaction.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is Mall_Customers.csv, which contains the following customer details:
CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income: Income of the customer in thousands.
Spending Score: A score assigned to each customer based on their spending behavior.
Feedback (optional): Customer feedback that can be analyzed for sentiment.

Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to segment mall customers into different clusters based on:
Demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income).
Behavioral characteristics (e.g., spending score).
Optional textual data (e.g., feedback) using NLP techniques.
By identifying these customer segments, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, improving customer retention and satisfaction.

Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Missing Data & Data Types: The dataset is inspected for missing values, and any missing values are handled accordingly.
Feature Selection & Scaling: Numerical features are selected, and scaling is applied to standardize the dataset for clustering algorithms.

2. Text Feature Extraction (Optional):
If a feedback column is available, it's processed using the SentenceTransformer model to generate text embeddings that represent the feedback data.
These embeddings are then combined with the numerical features for clustering.

3. Clustering Algorithms:
KMeans Clustering: The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. KMeans is applied to segment customers into clusters.
DBSCAN: A density-based clustering method is also applied to see if a different approach provides useful segmentation.

4. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space to two components for visualization. This allows us to plot the clusters and understand their structure better.

5. Cluster Profiling:
A cluster profile is generated by calculating the mean of each feature within each cluster, giving insights into the characteristics of each customer segment.

6. Data Visualization:
Correlation Matrix: A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlations between different features.

PCA Scatter Plot: A scatter plot of PCA components is used to visualize the clusters in a two-dimensional space.

Cluster Distribution: A bar chart and 3D scatter plot are used to visualize the distribution of customers across different clusters.

Pair Plot: A pairplot visualizes the relationships between different features and clusters.

7. Sentiment Analysis (Optional):
If a feedback column is available, Sentiment Analysis is performed on the textual feedback to classify it as positive or negative. This analysis provides additional insights into customer satisfaction.

Results:
Clustering Results:
KMeans: The dataset was segmented into 4 clusters using the KMeans algorithm.
DBSCAN: A different segmentation strategy was explored using DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm.
Cluster Profiling:

The average characteristics of each cluster were computed, such as the average age, income, and spending score, to profile each customer segment.

Dimensionality Reduction:
PCA was applied to reduce the feature space and allow for easy visualization of the clusters. The explained variance ratio indicated that the two components captured a significant amount of the data variance.

Visualizations:
Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores were used to assess the quality of the clustering results.
A 3D Scatter Plot and Pairplot were created to further analyze the clusters and their characteristics.

Sentiment Analysis:
The sentiment of customer feedback was analyzed and categorized as either positive or negative, providing deeper insights into customer satisfaction.

Conclusion:
The Mall Customer Segmentation project demonstrated how clustering techniques like KMeans and DBSCAN can be used to segment customers based on both demographic and behavioral data. By applying PCA for dimensionality reduction, visualizing the clusters, and profiling each segment, valuable insights were gained.
KMeans clustering provided the most meaningful segmentation of customers, resulting in 4 distinct clusters.
DBSCAN offered an alternative approach, focusing on density-based clustering.
PCA helped reduce complexity and allowed for easy visualization of customer segments.
Sentiment Analysis on feedback helped gain insights into customer satisfaction.
The project showcases how businesses can leverage data analysis and machine learning to better understand their customers and improve decision-making.

Future Work:
Advanced Clustering: Experiment with other clustering techniques such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) or Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering for potentially better results.

Feature Engineering: Add more features like purchase history, location data, or behavioral patterns from online activity to further refine the clusters.
